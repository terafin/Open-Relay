## ✨ What Is Open Relay?

Open Relay is a **100% SwiftUI** native iOS & iPadOS app that connects to your self-hosted [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com) server, giving you a fast, polished, truly native experience that the mobile web browser can't match.

Think of it as **ChatGPT on your phone** — but pointed at *your* server, running *your* models, with *your* data staying private.
