## ✨ What Is Open Relay?

Open Relay is a **100% SwiftUI** native iOS & iPadOS app that connects to your self-hosted [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com) server, giving you a fast, polished, truly native experience that the mobile web browser can't match.

Think of it as **ChatGPT on your phone** — but pointed at *your* server, running *your* models, with *your* data staying private.

## 🔗 URL Scheme

Open Relay supports a custom URL scheme (`openui://`) so you can launch the app and trigger actions from **Raycast, Obsidian, Apple Shortcuts, Home Assistant, terminal scripts**, or any tool that can open a URL.

### Supported URLs

| URL | What it does |
|---|---|
| `openui://new-chat` | Open a new chat with focus on the input field |
| `openui://new-chat?prompt=Hello` | Open a new chat with "Hello" pre-filled in the input |
| `openui://new-chat?prompt=Hello&send=true` | Open a new chat, pre-fill "Hello", and send it immediately |
| `openui://new-chat?model=gpt-4o` | Open a new chat and select the specified model |
| `openui://new-chat?prompt=Hello&model=gpt-4o&send=true` | Pre-fill, select a model, and auto-send |
| `openui://new-chat?mode=voice-recording` | Start a new AI voice call |
| `openui://continue` | Resume the last conversation |
| `openui://chat/{conversationId}` | Open a specific conversation by ID |
| `openui://voice-call` | Start a voice call |
| `openui://new-note` | Open the Notes section |
| `openui://new-channel` | Create a new Channel |
| `openui://note/{noteId}` | Open a specific note by ID |

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | Any text (max 4,000 chars) | Pre-fills the chat input field |
| `model` | Model ID string | Selects the model by ID (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `llama3.2`) |
| `send` | `true` | Auto-sends the prompt immediately (requires `prompt`) |
| `mode` | `voice-recording` | Opens a voice call instead of text chat |

### Examples

**Raycast Script Command:**
```bash
open "openui://new-chat?prompt=Summarize%20my%20clipboard&send=true"
```

**Apple Shortcut action:**
Use the built-in **"Ask Open Relay"** Shortcuts action (appears in the Shortcuts app under Open Relay) to open a chat with a prompt, optional model, and auto-send — all configurable from the Shortcuts editor.

**Home Assistant automation:**
```yaml
service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
data:
  message: "shortcut"
  data:
    url: "openui://new-chat?prompt=What%27s+the+weather+forecast%3F&send=true"
```
