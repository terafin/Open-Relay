# Changelog

## v5.5.2 — September 1, 2026

### Improvements
- Tightened conversation row spacing in the sidebar.
- Removed the duplicate update notification icon from the top of the sidebar

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed tool call cards showing a checkmark immediately when the model writes the call request
- Fixed responses finishing prematurely during long-running tool calls — the recovery timer no longer treats an empty task list as "done" when there is still an in-progress tool call waiting for a result.
- Fixed responses being marked as finished when returning from the background too quickly

## v5.5.1 — August 27, 2026

### What's New
- Added custom photo picker

### Improvements
- Allow OpenWebUI's new streaming architecture that now sends tokens as `response:completion` delta events which the app was silently discarding.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed assistant messages not appearing when sending new messages after clearing chat history or continuing responses
- Fixed TTS related issues with sentence breaking.
- Fixed app icon showing a badge number after every message even when the response finished while you were still in the app — the badge now only appears when you go to the home screen while a response is still streaming.


## v5.5 — August 26, 2026

### What's New
- Added in-app browser: tapping links and citation chips now opens a built-in browser instead of leaving the app.
- Added "Open links in app" toggle in Settings → Chat → Chat Behavior to disable the in-app browser for users who prefer to open links in Safari directly. On by default.
- Added API key management to Privacy & Security settings — generate, copy, and revoke your server API key directly from the app.
- Added human-in-the-loop tool approval: when your server admin enables it, a "Tool Permissions" entry appears in the + attachment menu with a sub-page to switch between Full access (tools run automatically) and Ask for approval (pauses before each tool call for Allow/Deny)
- Added ask-user question cards: models can now pause mid-response to ask you up to three multiple-choice questions before continuing, with an optional free-text answer field, the question surviving a reload so you can answer it later, and a live countdown timer for time-sensitive prompts.

### Improvements
- Failed tool calls now show a red ✗ instead of a green ✓, making it easy to spot when a tool ran into an error.
- Profile pictures that fail to load (such as those belonging to deleted accounts) now fall back to the default avatar instead of showing a broken placeholder.
- Typing @ in a channel now lists members in alphabetical order for more predictable results.
- Attaching a file and sending a message before the upload finishes now queues the message and sends it automatically once the upload completes.
- Added OpenSERP as a web search engine option in Admin → Web Search.
- Admin Documents: added Knowledge File Retention, CSV Shape Summary, and Metadata Max Value Characters settings.
- Admin Interface: added Task Model Generation Parameters editor with individual controls for all parameters (Temperature, top_k, top_p, Reasoning Effort, Function Calling, and more) — each defaults to "Default" and can be set individually, matching the web interface exactly.
- Admin Interface: added Default Interface Settings editor for configuring server-wide defaults applied to all new chats.
- Admin Integrations: Terminal server connections now have Enable in Chats, Enable in Automations, and Scope settings.
- Admin Groups: added Import Members button in the Users tab — import group members from a CSV file containing email addresses.
- Automations: added Channel Destination option so automation responses can be posted to a specific channel instead of creating a new chat.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed server update changelog api to github as the webui api does not provide the current update changelog.

## v5.4.2 — August 24, 2026

### Improvements
- Responses now show a notification when interrupted mid-stream (e.g. if the app was backgrounded too long), so you always know to tap back in and retry.
- Channel message notifications no longer stack up as duplicates from the same person — each sender gets one banner that updates in place.
- App badge now increments when responses or channel messages arrive, and clears when you tap a notification.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed tool call responses being dropped when a model executes multiple tools concurrently.
- Fixed a bug where content could appear doubled in responses that use the structured output format.
- Fixed a bug where Socket.IO connection "user-join" handshake could silently leak memory if the app was backgrounded during the 5-second acknowledgement window.
- Fixed a race condition in the Socket.IO polling transport where rapid reconnects could spawn two simultaneous polling loops, causing duplicate or dropped events.
- Fixed the streaming URL session not being reset when switching servers, which could send requests to the wrong server after a switch.
- Fixed a bug where the same AI response could fire two separate "response ready" notification banners (one from background polling and one from foreground recovery).

## v5.4.1 — August 23, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed admin users unable to edit models in Admin Console
- Fixed starred tool quick-action pills disappearing on app launch and new chat

## v5.4 — August 22, 2026

### What's New
- Added Controls panel (tap the slider icon in any chat) showing attached files, knowledge bases, reference chats, system prompt override, and tool/function valve settings

### Improvements
- Improved server switching: the "Switch Server" screen now has an X button to dismiss without switching, server rows show a reachability check before committing a switch, and the connection-lost overlay presents the switcher as a dismissible sheet.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed starred tool buttons persisting in the quick-actions row after a tool is deleted or removed from the server.
- Fixed hidden models not appearing in the workspace model editor's base model picker — admins can now select any enabled model (including hidden ones) as a base model when creating or editing workspace models, matching Open WebUI web behavior.

## v5.3.9 — August 21, 2026

### Improvements
- Admin Models screen now shows workspace custom models (e.g. models you've created from a base) alongside base models.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed second (and subsequent) reasoning/thinking blocks not appearing during streaming.
- Fixed admin model list only loading the first 30 models when more than 30 exist.
- Fixed all users appearing to have edit access to models they don't own; edit button is now greyed out for read-only models.
- Fixed "Hide Model" / "Show Model" failing for Ollama and other base models that don't yet have a workspace record.
- Fixed admin model settings (built-in tools toggles) always resetting to default because the server key names didn't match what the app expected.
- Fixed model public/private badge always showing "PRIVATE" due to access grants being checked in the wrong place.

## v5.3.8 — August 19, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed follow-up suggestions disappearing ~2 seconds after appearing due to server sync overwriting them with an empty array.
- Fixed follow-up suggestions not persisting when editing a message or switching between message versions.
- Fixed follow-up suggestions never appearing after regenerating a response.

- Fixed login screen appearing after returning from a long background

## v5.3.5 — August 15, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed HTTP polling fallback timing out after 60 seconds of silent processing — responses from long-running tasks now wait for the server to confirm the task is complete before finalising, preventing truncated or missing responses.

## v5.3.4 — August 14, 2026

### Improvements
- Minor animation tweaking throughout the app for smoothness.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed app logging out on every launch — removed an overly aggressive JWT expiry check that was treating tokens with less than 5 minutes remaining as already expired, matching Open WebUI's approach of letting the server decide token validity via 401.

## v5.3.3 — August 14, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed app permanently freezing on the launch screen when the server was slow or unreachable.
- Fixed login screen briefly flashing on launch when on a slow or unreachable network.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed sending a message after deleting the last message in a chat incorrectly adding it as a version of the deleted message instead of starting a fresh new chat.

## v5.3.1 — August 12, 2026

### Improvements
- Improved networking resilience with automatic retry (up to 2 attempts with backoff) on transient network errors and server errors across all API calls.
- Improved streaming resilience with a 60-second stall watchdog that terminates hung SSE connections instead of waiting forever.
- Improved session security by automatically signing out when any API call receives a 401, so expired tokens never leave the app in a broken state.
- Improved streaming reliability by correctly handling multi-line server-sent events per the SSE spec.
- Improved stop-generation to cancel all server-side tasks for a chat in a single request instead of one per task.
- Improved session security by automatically treating stored auth tokens as expired when they are within 5 minutes of their expiry time, preventing 401 errors mid-session.
- Improved image loading efficiency with conditional HTTP requests (ETag/Last-Modified), allowing the server to respond with 304 Not Modified and skip re-downloading unchanged images.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed app getting stuck on the loading screen when the server is slow or temporarily unreachable on launch.

## v5.3 — August 12, 2026

### What's New
- Folders now support a custom emoji icon and background images

## v5.2.2 — August 5, 2026

### Improvements
- Chats started inside a folder now correctly send the folder context to the server, ensuring folder-level knowledge and system prompts are applied and the sidebar updates properly.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed memories not being used in chat — the app now correctly falls back to the server's global memories setting when no explicit preference is stored in the user's account, matching OpenWebUI's behavior.

## v5.2.1 — August 5, 2026

### What's New
- Added iPad sidebar layout toggle in Settings → Appearance: choose between "Always Show Sidebar" (pinned split-view) or the default slide-out drawer overlay.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed tool calls causing the entire chat response to freeze with no output
- Fixed tool call responses silently delivering no content — events containing only tool call data (no text yet) are no longer dropped.
- Fixed tool call JSON arguments being corrupted

## v5.2 — August 4, 2026

### Improvements
- Added option in Privacy & Security settings to exclude downloaded AI models (TTS/ASR) from iCloud backup — models are redownloadable so they don't need to consume iCloud storage. Enabled by default. (Turn Open Relay off/on in the icloud backup setting to apply.)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed workspace model system prompts being ignored mid-conversation — the app now correctly falls back to the model's server-side system prompt when no per-chat or personal default prompt is set, so changes made in the OpenWebUI workspace are picked up immediately.
- Fixed memories not being injected into conversations — the memory enabled/disabled toggle now stays in sync across all new chats opened after the toggle is changed.

## v5.1 — August 1, 2026

### What's New
- Added swipe-to-reply gesture in channels — swipe right on any message to reply.
- Reply previews inside message bubbles now show the sender's avatar, name, and a content preview, and tapping them scrolls to and highlights the original message.

- iPad: selecting a channel from the sidebar now correctly closes the drawer and loads the channel.
- iPad sidebar now slides in and out with the same push/scale/blur animation as iPhone — tap the sidebar button or swipe from the left edge to open, swipe left or tap the content to close.
- Channels now show a live "X is typing…" indicator with an animated dot pulse when another user is composing a message.
- New channels and DM conversations started by others now appear in your sidebar instantly without needing to pull-to-refresh.
- Thread reply counts and "# replies" badges on channel messages now update in real time when a new reply is posted.
- Channel member presence state and status emoji/message are now fetched from the server for more accurate online indicators.
- AI model responses in channels now show an animated "Generating…" indicator in the bubble while the model is writing its first tokens, instead of a blank gap.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed DM conversations showing the wrong name — the recipient's sidebar now correctly shows the sender's name instead of their own name.
- Fixed online/offline status dot in DM conversations always showing as offline even when the other user is actively connected — now correctly reflects the server's real-time active status both in the sidebar and inside the DM.
- Fixed iPad sidebar hamburger menu button not appearing when on the new chat screen or inside a chat.
- Fixed chat responses sometimes never arriving after sending a message, with the server showing "Checking..." indefinitely — caused by a timing race where messages could be sent before the connection was fully ready.
- Fixed the app treating local network servers differently from remote ones, which could cause inconsistent connection status.
- Fixed channel lifecycle events (channel updated/deleted) not being handled in the sidebar, which could leave stale channels visible.
- Fixed occasional duplicate messages when sending two identical messages in quick succession in a channel.

- Terminal now has a fullscreen mode — tap the expand button in the terminal toolbar to open a full-screen terminal view with more room to work.
- Terminal now shows a quick-action shortcut bar with Tab, history up/down (↑ ↓), and Clear buttons for faster keyboard-free input.

### Improvements
- Terminal shell now starts warming up as soon as you enable terminal access, so input is ready instantly when you open the panel.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed terminal output displaying raw ANSI escape codes (e.g. `[1m[96m…[0m`) instead of clean text.
- Fixed terminal access (terminal_id) still being included in chat requests even after disabling the terminal toggle.
- Fixed server update changelog showing raw HTML code blocks or being invisible — now renders as native SwiftUI views with bold titles and color-coded category labels.
- Server update sheet now shows the server's favicon as the icon (with a server.rack fallback if unavailable).
- Fixed conversation tags not appearing — tags were being read from the wrong field in the server response; now correctly reads from the updated server format.
- Fixed conversation timestamps (created/updated dates) showing the wrong time after loading a chat — the server sends them as integers which weren't being handled correctly.

## v4.1 — May 8, 2026

### What's New
- Long-press any chat inside a folder to enter selection mode — multi-select, then remove from folder, move to another folder, or delete in bulk.
- Added "Move to Folder" button in the main chat list's selection toolbar — select multiple chats and move them all into a folder at once.
- Added server update notifications — the app now checks your Open WebUI server for available updates on launch. A "Check for Server Updates" button is also available in About → Server.
- Image size reduction - 5mb cap on vision models cause error if the image is too big.
- Native visualizations now support audio output.

### Improvements
- Minor code block performance improvements.
- Removed "Clear Local Cache" option from Privacy & Security settings as Storage Menu covers it all.

### Bug Fixes
- Terminal now runs as a persistent bash session with proper stdin support; suppressed harmless startup warnings
- Fixed terminal remaining active for the model after disabling it — the model no longer receives terminal access when the toggle is off
- Fixed admin-disabled terminal servers appearing as available and being silently used in requests
- Fixed multi-server terminal: switching servers with the toggle off no longer leaves a stale server selected that could re-activate on the next enable
- Fixed folders only showing up to 10 chats — now loads all chats across all pages smoothly
- Fixed typing indicator animation
- Fixed update notice incorrectly triggering based on GitHub tags instead of the actual App Store version.

## v4.0 — May 5, 2026

### What's New
- Added dedicated Input Box Text size slider in Accessibility settings — independently scale the font in the chat and channel message composer.
- A complete re-write of the streaming pipeline — Massively improved streaming performance. App should feel fully responsive while streaming. 

### Improvements
- Switching between chats should feel smoother. 
- Screen now stays on while TTS is reading a response aloud, just like during voice calls.
- Voice calls now respect the admin-configured Voice Mode prompt from OpenWebUI's interface settings — the model automatically receives the right system prompt to keep responses concise and speech-friendly.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed nested code blocks rendering as plain text.
- Fixed citation source icons showing as letter avatars instead of favicons.
- Known Issue: Inline visualizer plugin is not correctly working with the new re-write and needs a bit more work. Continue using the native visualizer which works perfectly and much better than pluggin. In future, the pluggin support may be dropped as it requires lot of processing since its written for the webui (includes iframe code in the tool block) and causes lag and has no real benifit over the native visualization. 

## v3.5 — May 3, 2026

### What's New
- Added user valve editor for tools — tap the gear icon next to any tool in the tools picker to configure its settings.
- Added in-app update notice — the app checks for new versions on every launch and shows a sheet with release notes; tapping "Later" dismisses it and leaves an update icon next to the New Chat button in sidebar so you can reopen it anytime.
- Added star button to every tool in the tools picker — tap ⭐ to instantly pin it as a quick-action pill in the chat input, no settings detour required.

- Streaming responses now scroll more smoothly with less jank, reduced CPU usage, and no animation stutter.
- Dramatically improved performance for reasoning/thinking models — the app no longer gets slower as the model thinks longer.
- Channel deletes, edits, reactions, and pins from other devices now appear live without needing to refresh.
- Deleting a channel message now animates out instantly instead of waiting for the server.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TTS audio not playing through earbuds or wired headphones in both chat read-aloud and voice calls.
- Fixed regenerated responses not showing server errors in the chat bubble
- Fixed the chat not scrolling to the regenerating message — regenerating a response now animates the view to the new message the same way sending does.
- Fixed non-toggleable filters incorrectly appearing under Default Filters in the model editor.
- Fixed toggle-filter functions in the tools picker always turning on when globally enabled, ignoring the model's configured default state.
- Fixed crash in channels when deleting a message.
- Fixed channel context menu appearing off-screen when the keyboard was open.
- Fixed new chats always starting with the last-used model instead of the server-configured default model.
- Fixed Settings → Default Model changes not applying to new chats opened in the same session.
- Hidden models (disabled by an admin in OpenWebUI) no longer appear in the model picker or the Default Model setting.
- Fixed thinking blocks breaking the "Explored N" tool-call grouping on reasoning models — all tool calls now collapse into a single pill as expected.

No need for Inline visualizer pluggin (Works with it as well!). Add "output the code in one file" (or create a prompt in your worspace instead of typing it each time) at the end of your prompt and watch it get built live!

### Improvements
- Consecutive tool calls from different tools now group into a single collapsible row, matching the web UI.
- Citation badges in AI responses now show domain names by default instead of full page titles, and correctly render grouped citations like [1, 2, 3]. Toggle between domain and title in Settings → Chat Behavior.
- Improved math rendering accuracy — formulas inside code blocks now correctly restore their original delimiters instead of showing placeholder text.
- Tables with clickable links now handle taps more reliably, and table cells are reused more efficiently for smoother scrolling.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed JavaScript not executing in HTML code block previews — interactive apps like Kanban boards, games, and dashboards now work correctly, including drag-and-drop, button clicks, and localStorage persistence.
- Switching accounts now instantly clears the chat list and reloads conversations, folders, and channels for the new account.
- Fixed some action buttons not working that required js to complete its task.

- Fixed server-side TTS accumulating gigabytes of temporary audio files over time — each spoken sentence now deletes its temp file immediately after playback, and any unplayed files are cleaned up when TTS is stopped.
- Fixed app crash when backgrounding during on-device speech-to-text transcription.
- Fixed thinking/reasoning blocks not responding to taps while a response is streaming — you can now expand or collapse the thinking block at any time during streaming.
- Fixed memories getting disabled by itself — pinning a model, changing the default model, or toggling memory from any screen no longer wipes other user settings.
- Fixed default model not sticking — pinning a model was incorrectly overwriting the default model setting with the pinned models list.

## v2.3.1 — March 30, 2026

### What's New
- Added German and French conversational voice options for Marvis Neural TTS.
- Added minimize/PiP for voice calls — tap the chevron button in the voice call screen to shrink it to a floating pill. Tap the pill to restore the full call, or tap the red button to end it. The call stays active while minimized.

### Improvements

- Toggle-filter functions now appear as toggleable tools in the Tools menu alongside regular tools.
- Filter functions are now properly resolved using the global vs per-model logic — global filters always apply, per-model filters respect configuration.
- Starter prompt cards on the welcome screen now fall back to per-model suggestion prompts when the admin hasn't set global prompts, and update automatically when switching models.
- The TTS/STT settings screen now correctly shows "Not Loaded" (when the model is downloaded but not in memory) vs "Not Downloaded" (when no model files exist on disk), and the download/load button label and icon also adapt accordingly.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed on-device TTS and STT models taking up twice the expected storage — the HuggingFace download library was leaving a duplicate blob cache alongside the working model files. Existing users will automatically reclaim the wasted space on their next app launch.
- Fixed Shift+Enter intermittently sending the message instead of inserting a new line on iPad with a hardware keyboard.
- Fixed accessibility sizing not applying to assistant messages, drawer lists, and input boxes. 
- Fixed orphaned `</think>` closing tags leaking into chat messages as visible code blocks when models like Qwen skip the opening tag or when streaming splits tags across chunks.
- Fixed selecting a model and immediately sending a message no longer uses stale config.

## v2.2 — March 28, 2026

- Model picker now shows the currently selected model at the top of the sheet for easy reference.

### Improvements
- Home screen widgets with full theme support — widgets now properly adapt to Default, Dark, Clear, and Tinted modes instead of being stuck on a dark background.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed thinking/reasoning blocks from models (Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.) showing as raw tags in the chat instead of rendering as a collapsible "Thinking" section. Now handles all six reasoning tag formats during streaming and fixes stray summary tags leaking mid-stream.

- Fixed audio file transcription being cancelled when navigating away from a chat — transcription now continues in the background and completes even if you switch chats.
- Fixed channels incorrectly showing as read-only for the channel owner and members with write access when access grants were present.
- Fixed background chat content (e.g. prompt cards) being accidentally tappable or scrollable while swiping to open the left or right drawer panel.
- Fixed function calling mode not being respected — the app was incorrectly overriding the server's per-model setting; it now lets the server control this entirely, matching the web client behavior.

## v1.2 — March 16, 2026

### What's New
- Added Channels — collaborative, topic-based chat rooms where multiple users and AI models interact.
- Added Accessibility settings with customizable text scaling — independently adjust message text, conversation titles, and UI elements (buttons, icons, spacing) with live preview and quick presets.
- Added slash command prompt library — type `/` in the chat input to browse and search your Open WebUI prompt library.

### Improvements
- Inline source citations now appear as small, elevated pill badges showing shortened page titles or domain names — matching the Open WebUI web interface style.
- Profile/model avatars will now show properly.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed repeated `heartbeat() missing 1 required positional argument: 'data'` errors in Open WebUI server logs
- Fixed web search, image generation, and code interpreter toggles being ignored when turned off mid-chat — toggling a tool off now correctly prevents it from being used.
- Fixed conversations older than "This Month" not loading — pagination now properly triggers when scrolling to the bottom, allowing all conversation history to load.

## v1.1.0 — March 12, 2026

### What's New
- Added Cloudflare protected endpoint support.

### Improvements
- Full iPad layout overhaul — persistent sidebar, centered reading width, 4-column prompt grid, terminal as persistent panel.
- Added example URL placeholder in the server connection field so users know to include http:// or https:// in their URL.
- Moved the terminal toggle from the pills row to a compact inline icon next to the voice button, keeping the chat input single-line when no quick pills are pinned.
- Redesigned onboarding experience.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed dollar amounts being incorrectly rendered as math equations instead of plain text.
- Fixed stale model list persisting after signing out and logging into a different server or account — models now refresh correctly without needing to restart the app.
- Fixed model avatars not updating when changed by the admin — avatar images are now properly invalidated and re-fetched on each model refresh.
- Fixed false proxy error on Cloudflare-protected servers.

## v1.0.0 — March 12, 2026

### What's New
- Added `@` model mention — type `@` in the chat input to quickly switch which model handles your message. Pick a model from the fluent popup, and a persistent chip appears in the composer showing the active override. The override stays until you dismiss it or pick a different model, letting you freely switch between models mid-conversation without changing the chat's default.
- Added Open Terminal integration — enable terminal access for AI models directly from the chat input pill, giving the model the ability to run commands, manage files, and interact with a real Linux environment.
- Added Terminal File Browser — swipe from the right edge to open a slide-over file panel with directory navigation, breadcrumb path bar, file upload, folder creation, file preview/download, and a built-in mini terminal for running commands directly.
- Added native SVG rendering in chat messages — AI-generated SVG code blocks now display as crisp, zoomable images with a header bar, Image/Source toggle, copy button, and fullscreen view with pinch-to-zoom and share sheet support.
- Added native Mermaid diagram rendering in chat messages (flowcharts, state, sequence, class, and ER diagrams rendered as beautiful images).
- Added Memories management (Settings → Personalization → Memories) — view, add, edit, and delete AI memories that persist across conversations.
- Added "Archive All Chats" option in the chat list menu for bulk archiving.

### Improvements
- App now sends timezone to the server on login, matching the web client for correct server-side date formatting.
- Archived chats endpoint now supports search, sort, and filter parameters for faster navigation.
- Matching formatting of content to the Open WebUI formatting.
- Sidebar drawer now slides smoothly with your finger.
- Returning to an existing chat now remembers the last model used in that conversation instead of reverting to the default model.
- Unified TTS and STT under a single mlx-audio-swift package, replacing two separate dependencies for smaller app size and easier maintenance.
- Improved audio transcription for long files with energy-based silence detection for smarter chunking at natural pauses.
- Smoother TTS audio playback with automatic crossfading between chunks, eliminating audio artifacts at sentence boundaries.
- User-attached images and files now display inline inside the message bubble instead of floating above it.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed chat search using wrong query parameter, which could cause search to silently fail on some server versions.
- Fixed tag removal using incorrect API endpoint format (path-based instead of body-based DELETE).
- Fixed tag addition using wrong request body field name.
- Fixed tags list fetching from wrong endpoint, now uses the correct structured tags API.
- Fixed clone conversation not sending required request body.
- Fixed feature toggles (Web Search, Image Generation, Code Interpreter) still appearing in the tools menu even when the admin disabled the capability on the model. Toggles now respect per-model capabilities.
- Fixed tool-generated file download links opening in Safari instead of downloading within the app. Files are now downloaded and presented via the share sheet.
- Fixed some chats created from the app appearing blank or corrupted on the Open WebUI web interface.
- Fixed uploaded photos, PDFs, and other files not displaying on the Open WebUI web interface when sent from the app.
- Fixed chat view becoming pannable in all directions after follow-up suggestions appear, instead of strictly vertical scrolling.
- Fixed image uploads exceeding the 5 MB API limit by automatically downsampling photos to 2 megapixels before upload.
- Fixed external response stream not stopping when clicking the stop button.
